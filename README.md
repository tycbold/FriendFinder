This was a challenging assignment. To be honest, I took a fair amount from the Hot Restaurant activity, and I also copied the home.html and survey.html pages from the demo that was given to us, only making minor CSS adjustments. 

The logic for finding the score differences I wrote myself, but honestly I'm not sure if it works. I've had a lot of trouble figuring out how to de-bug and my server has not been initializing and I don't know why so I can't test it very easily either.
